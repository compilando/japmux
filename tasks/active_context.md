# Active Context - JAPM Project

This document provides a snapshot of the current focus, recent developments, and immediate next steps for the JAPM project.

## Current Focus

The primary focus remains on enhancing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) across various modules of the JAPM application, particularly for prompt and asset version management, and improving the intuitiveness of administrative tasks. Ensuring data consistency between the frontend and backend, especially concerning DTOs and API payloads, is also a key concern.

## Recent Developments (Last Cycle)

Over the past development cycle, significant progress has been made in several areas:

1.  **Git-like Version History UI:**
    *   Redesigned the prompt versions page (`src/app/(admin)/projects/[projectId]/prompts/[promptId]/versions/page.tsx` and `PromptVersionsTable.tsx`) to display versions in a vertical timeline, resembling a Git history. This includes version tags, relative publication dates, change reasons, and hover effects.
    *   Implemented expandable summaries for prompt text in the version history.
    *   Added a `GitBranchIcon` for visual enhancement.
    *   Applied a similar Git-like vertical timeline design with cards to the prompt asset versions page (`src/app/(admin)/projects/[projectId]/prompts/[promptId]/assets/[assetId]/versions/page.tsx` and `PromptAssetVersionsTable.tsx`).

2.  **Iconography Update:**
    *   Changed the clock icon to a language icon for translations on both the prompt asset versions table and the prompt versions table.

3.  **Sidebar Navigation Simplification:**
    *   Removed the "Prompt Management" group from the main sidebar (`AppSidebar.tsx`), elevating "My Prompts" to a top-level item.
    *   Addressed and resolved issues related to active state highlighting in the sidebar after this change (`SidebarNavItem.tsx`).

4.  **Prompt Version Translation Page Enhancement:**
    *   Improved the structure and design of the translations page for prompt versions (`src/app/(admin)/projects/[projectId]/prompts/[promptId]/versions/[versionId]/translations/page.tsx`).
    *   Implemented a two-column layout for the original prompt text and the translations table to share horizontal space and reduce scrolling.
    *   Styled the original prompt display box with ChatGPT-like colors (dark background, light text).
    *   Modernized the `PromptTranslationForm.tsx` with improved design, loading states, error handling, and validation.
    *   Improved the `PromptTranslationsTable.tsx` styling.

5.  **Prompt Version Creation Form ("Add Prompt Version" Modal Replacement):**
    *   Replaced the modal for adding a new prompt version with an inline, two-column form (`PromptVersionForm.tsx`) on the versions page.
    *   The left column displays the prompt text of the previous version for comparison.
    *   The right column contains the form for the new version's details (prompt text, change reason, version tag).
    *   Applied ChatGPT-like styling (dark theme, monospace font) to the prompt text areas in this form.

6.  **`versionTag` Handling for New Prompt Versions:**
    *   Investigated and resolved an issue where `versionTag` was not being correctly passed to the backend when creating a new prompt version.
    *   The immediate fix involved casting the payload to `any` in `src/app/(admin)/projects/[projectId]/prompts/[promptId]/versions/page.tsx` before calling `promptVersionService.create`.
    *   **Identified Root Cause:** The `CreatePromptVersionDto` interface in the generated API client is out of sync with the backend API, which expects `versionTag`.

7.  **Prompts Table UI Improvement:**
    *   Enhanced the main prompts table (`PromptsTable.tsx`) to make the entire card clickable as a link to the prompt details and improved hover effects for better UX.

8.  **Prompt Wizard (`prompt-wizard/page.tsx`):**
    *   Reviewed the functionality of the Prompt Wizard, which assists users in generating and loading prompt structures (including prompt info, versions, assets, and translations) from natural language or by loading JSON.

## Key Learnings & Action Items

*   **DTO Synchronization:** The `versionTag` issue highlights a critical need to ensure the OpenAPI specification (`service/openapi.json`) accurately reflects the backend API contract.
    *   **Action:** Prioritize updating the OpenAPI spec and regenerating the API client to include `versionTag` in `CreatePromptVersionDto` and any other discrepancies.
*   **Component Reusability:** Continue to identify opportunities for creating reusable UI components to maintain consistency and speed up development (e.g., for tables, forms, display elements).
*   **User Feedback:** The iterative UI/UX improvements based on perceived "fakeness" or usability issues (e.g., modal vs. inline form, clickable links) are valuable. Continue to adopt a user-centric approach.

## Next Immediate Steps

1.  Generate the `tasks/tasks_plan.md` document.
2.  Address the DTO synchronization issue by updating the OpenAPI specification and regenerating the client.
3.  Review other areas of the application for potential UI/UX enhancements based on recent successful patterns (e.g., Git-like history, inline forms, clearer visual cues).
